title:  Region Naming
---

To be able to perform all available operations on your data regions,
follow these region naming guidelines.

-   Permitted characters within region names are alphanumeric characters
(`ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789`),
the underscore character (`_`), and the hyphen character (`-`).
-   Keep region names short.
-   Do not use the slash character (`/`).
-   Do not begin region names with two underscore characters (`__`),
as this is reserved for internal Geode use.
