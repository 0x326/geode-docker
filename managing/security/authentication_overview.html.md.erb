title:  Authentication
---

Authentication verifies the identities of components within the distributed
system such as peers, clients, and those connecting to a JMX manager.

-   **[Implementing Authentication](../../managing/security/implementing_authentication.html)**

    All components of the distributed system authenticate the same way,
    through a custom-written method.

-   **[Encrypting Passwords for Use in cache.xml](../../managing/security/encrypting_passwords.html)**

    Apache Geode provides a gfsh utility to generate encrypted passwords.

-   **[Encrypt Credentials with Diffie-Hellman](../../managing/security/encrypting_with_diffie_helman.html)**

    For secure transmission of sensitive information, like passwords, you can encrypt credentials using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm.

-   **[Authentication Example](../../managing/security/authentication_examples.html)**

    The example demonstrates the basics of an implementation of the
`SecurityManager.authenticate` method.
