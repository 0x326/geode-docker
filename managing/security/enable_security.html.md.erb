title:  Enable Security with Property Definitions
---


The callbacks that implement the authorization of an application
are specified with the `security-manager` property.
When this property is defined, authorization is enabled.
The definition of the `security-manager` property is the
path to the implementation of the `SecurityManager` interface.
For example:

``` pre
security-manager = com.example.security.MySecurityManager
```

All components of the system invoke the same callback.
Authorization may be enabled on a component basis with
the definition of the `security-enabled-components` property.
Its definition restricts which system components invoke
the authorization callback.

- `all`.  All components invoke the `authorize` callback.
- `server`.
- `cluster`.
- `jmx`. Invokes the `authorize` callback for all components
that ?
- `http`.
- `gateway`.

The `security-enabled-components` property defines 
a comma-separated list of components that will
invoke the `authorize` callback.
For example,

``` pre
security-enabled-components = server, cluster jmx
```
``` pre
security-post-processor = com.example.security.MySecurityPostProcessing
```
