# External Interfaces, Ports, and Services

<span class="keyword">Geode</span> processes use either UDP or TCP/IP ports to communicate with other processes or clients.

For example:
-   Members can use multicast to communicate with peer members. You specify multicast addresses and multicast ports in your `gemfire.properties` file or as parameters on the command-line when starting the members using `gfsh`.
-   Clients connect to a locator to discover cache servers.
-   JMX clients (such as `gfsh` and JConsole) can connect to JMX Managers and other manageable members on the pre-defined RMI port 1099. You can configure a different port if necessary.
-   Each gateway receiver usually has a port range where it listens for incoming communication.

See [Firewalls and Ports](../../configuring/running/firewalls_ports.html#concept_5ED182BDBFFA4FAB89E3B81366EBC58E) for the complete list of ports used by <span class="keyword">Geode</span>, their default values, and how to configure them if you do not want to use the default value.

<span class="keyword">Geode</span> does not have any external interfaces or services that need to be enabled or opened.

## Resources That Must Be Protected

Certain <span class="keyword">Geode</span> configuration files should be readable and writeable *only* by the dedicated user who runs servers.

-   `gemfire.properties`
-   `cache.xml`
-   `gfsecurity.properties`
    **Note:** A default <span class="ph filepath">gfsecurity.properties</span> is not provided in the <span class="ph filepath">defaultConfigs</span> directory. If you choose to use this properties file, you must create it manually. See [Where to Place Security Settings](where_to_place_sec_settings.html#implementing_security) for more information.

The default location of the <span class="ph filepath">gemfire.properties</span> and <span class="ph filepath">cache.xml</span> configuration files is the `defaultConfigs` child directory of the main installation directory.

## Log File Locations

By default, the log files are located in the working directory used when you started the corresponding processes.

For <span class="keyword">Geode</span> members (locators and cache servers), you can also specify a custom working directory location when you start each process. See [Logging](../logging/logging.html#concept_30DB86B12B454E168B80BB5A71268865) for more details.

The log files are as follows:

-   `locator-name.log`: Contains logging information for the locator process.
-   `server-name.log`: Contains logging information for a cache server process.
-   `gfsh-%u_%g.log`: Contains logging information of an individual gfsh environment and session.
    **Note:** By default, `gfsh` session logging is disabled. To enable gfsh logging, you must set the Java system property `-Dgfsh.                                 log-level=desired_log_level`. See [Configuring the gfsh Environment](../../tools_modules/gfsh/configuring_gfsh.html#concept_3B9C6CE2F64841E98C33D9F6441DF487) for more information.

These log files should be readable and writable *only* by the dedicated user who runs the servers.
