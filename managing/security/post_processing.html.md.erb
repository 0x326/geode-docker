title:  Post Processing of Region Data
---

The  `PostProcessor` interface allows the definition of a set of callbacks
that are invoked after operations that get data,
but before the data is returned.
This permits the callback to intervene and modify of the data
that is to be returned.
The callbacks do not modify the region data,
only the data to be returned.
