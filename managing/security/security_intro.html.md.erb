Encryption, SSL secure communication, authentication, and authorization 
features help to secure the distributed system.

Apache Geode features:

-   **Single interface for all components**. one way to rule them all
-   **System-wide role-based access control**. authorization
-   **SSL communication**. Allows configuration of connections to be 
SSL-based, rather than plain socket connections.
You can enable SSL separately for peer-to-peer, client, JMX, gateway senders and receivers, and HTTP connections.
-   **Post processing of region data**. Filtering of return values for get type ops, to permit things like masking off fields. Allows authorization callbacks to modify or filter data from the server.
-   **Sample implementations**. Authentication and authorization sample implementations.
