title:  Security Features

Encryption, SSL secure communication, authentication, and authorization 
features help to secure the distributed system.

The features include:

-   **A single security interface for all components**. The single
authentication and authorization mechanism simplifies the security
implementation.
It views and interacts with all components in a consistent manner. 
-   **System-wide role-based access control**.
Roles regiment authorized operations requested by the various components.
-   **SSL communication**. Allows configuration of connections to be 
SSL-based, rather than plain socket connections.
You can enable SSL separately for peer-to-peer, client, JMX, gateway senders and receivers, and HTTP connections.
-   **Post processing of region data**. Return values for operations that
return region values may be altered, permitting the filtering of returned data.
