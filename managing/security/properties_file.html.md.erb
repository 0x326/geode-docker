title: Where to Place Security Configuration Settings 
---
<a id="implementing_security__section_155ED414321E4D4ABBD7ED3508E7BD62"></a>

Any security-related (properties that begin with `security-*`) configuration properties that are normally configured in `gemfire.properties` can be moved to a separate `gfsecurity.properties` file. Placing these configuration settings in a separate file allows you to restrict access to security configuration data. This way, you can still allow read or write access for your `gemfire.properties` file.

Upon startup, Geode processes will look for the `gfsecurity.properties` file in the following locations in order:

-   current working directory
-   user's home directory
-   classpath

If any password-related security properties are listed in the file but have a blank value, the process will prompt the user to enter a password upon startup.
