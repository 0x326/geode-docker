Distributed system and cache operations can be restricted, intercepted and
modifed, or completely blocked based on configured access rights set for
the various distributed system entities. 

-   **[How Authorization Works](../../managing/security/how_authorization_works.html)**

    The security framework establishes trust between members during authentication. In a client/server system, you can use this trust to grant or withhold a client's cache access and modification requests.

-   **[Implementing Authorized Access Control for the Cache](../../managing/security/implementing_authorization.html)**

    To use authorization for client/server systems, your client connections must be authenticated by their servers.

-   **[Performance and Programming Considerations](../../managing/security/authorization_whats_next.html)**

    This section provides guidelines for improving the efficiency of the authorization process.

-   **[Authorization Example](../../managing/security/authorization_example.html)**

    This topic discusses the authorization example provided in the product under `templates/security` using `XmlAuthorization.java`, `XmlErrorHandler.java`, and `authz6_0.dtd`.
