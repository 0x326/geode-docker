title:  Security Implementation Overview
---

Apache Geode can authenticate system members, clients, and other system
entities. It can also individually authorize cache operations 
for those various entities.

For aspects of the secure communication:

-   Use consistent security settings between similar processes in a single distributed system. For example, configure all servers in a system with the same client authentication settings.
-   If you have a client/server system, implement any authorized access control your servers will use for clients attempting to access or modify the cache.
-   If you want to use secure socket layer (SSL) protocol for your peer-to-peer and client/server connections, implement that. You can configure SSL separately for peer-to-peer, client/server, gateway senders and receivers, JMX, 
and HTTP connections.
