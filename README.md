# Building the container image

The current Dockerfile is based on a CentOS 6 image, downloads JDK 8, clone the Apache Geode git repository, starts a build and execute the basic tests. 

```
docker build .
```

This may take a while depending on your internet connection, but it's worth since this is a one time step and you endup with a container that is tested and ready to be used for development. It will download Gradle and as part of the build, project dependencies as well. 

# Starting a locator and gfsh

1. Then you can start gfsh as well in order to perform more commands:

```
docker run -it -p 10334:10334 -p 7575:7575 -p 1099:1099  apache/geode gfsh
```


From this point you can pretty much follow [Apache Geode in 5 minutes](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/GEODE/Index#Index-Geodein5minutes) for example:

```
start server --name=server1
```

But in order to have real fun with containers you are probably better off using something like docker-compose or kubernetes. Those examples will come next.

...Create a docker-compose.yml
