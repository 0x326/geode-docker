title:  SSL Client/Server Communication
---

This section describes how to configure OpenSSL, implement SSL-based communication between your clients and servers, and run clients and servers with SSL enabled.

-   **[Set Up OpenSSL](../../nativeclient/security/ssl-setup.html)**

-   **[Limitations](../../nativeclient/security/limitations.html)**

    Currently the native client only supports the NULL cipher with mutual authentication for SSL socket communications.
