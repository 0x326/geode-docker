title:  Serialize with PDX Serialization
---

<span class="keyword">Geode</span>'s Portable Data eXchange (PDX) is a cross-language data format that can reduce the cost of distributing and serializing your objects. PDX stores data in named fields that you can access individually, to avoid the cost of deserializing the entire data object. PDX also allows you to mix versions of objects where you have added or removed fields.

PDX serialization is supported by C++ clients. If you have C++ clients that may receive events for a region, you can now use PDX serialization on the region's entries.

You have two options for <span class="keyword">Geode</span> PDX serialization when using the C\# .NET caching API. You can program your domain objects using the `IPdxSerializable` interface, or you can use <span class="keyword">Geode</span>â€™s reflection-based autoserializer.
