title:  Installing the Hibernate Cache Module
---

The Hibernate module is included in the Apache Geode installation package.

1.  If you have not done so, download and install [Hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org/). Apache Geode supports Hibernate 3.3 and later (up to version 3.6.10) for use with the Hibernate Cache module. Apache Geode does not currently support Hibernate 4.x for use with the Hibernate Cache module.
2.  The Hibernate module is included in the Apache Geode installation package. You can find the module in the `<product_dir>/tools/Modules` directory, in a zip file that includes the version and the string `Hibernate`. `<product_dir>` is the location where you installed Geode.
3.  Make sure that `<product_dir>/lib/geode-dependencies.jar` is part of the CLASSPATH when you run Hibernate. Alternatively, you can place the `geode-dependencies.jar` in a location that is accessible to your Hibernate application.
