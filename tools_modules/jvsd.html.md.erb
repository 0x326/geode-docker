## JVSD Overview

JVSD is an open source tool for review of the <span class="keyword">Geode</span> metrics.

## Installing and Running JVSD

JVSD is available as a feature branch of the <span class="keyword">Geode</span> repository. To install and run JVSD:

1. Make sure that you have a recent checkout of <span class="keyword">Geode</span> and that you are on the JVSD branch, `feature/GEODE-78`.

``` pre
$ git status 
On branch feature/GEODE-78
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/feature/GEODE-78'.
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```

2. Build the MultiAxisChart:

``` pre
$ ./gradlew geode-jvsd:clean geode-jvsd:MultiAxisChart
:geode-jvsd:clean
:clean UP-TO-DATE
:geode-jvsd:MultiAxisChartFX
Cloning MultiAxisChartFX... 
Cloning MultiAxisChartFX... Done! 
Installing MultiAxisChartFX into local maven repository... 
Installing MultiAxisChartFX into local maven repository... Done!  

BUILD SUCCESSFUL 
```

At this point you should have the MultiAxisChart JAR file:

``` pre
$ ls -la geode-jvsd/build/MultiAxisChartFX/target/MultiAxisChart-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar  
-rw-r--r-- 1 jvuser staff 69979 Apr 1 07:21 geode-jvsd/build/MultiAxisChartFX/target/MultiAxisChart-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 
```

This JAR file should also now be installed in your local maven repository:

``` pre
 $ ls -la ~/.m2/repository/com/pivotal/javafx/MultiAxisChart/1.0-SNAPSHOT
total 168 
drwxr-xr-x 6 jvuser staff   204   Apr 1 07:14 . 
drwxr-xr-x 4 jvuser staff   136   Apr 1 07:14 .. 
-rw-r--r-- 1 jvuser staff 69979 Apr 1 07:21 MultiAxisChart-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 
-rw-r--r-- 1 jvuser staff  1751  Apr 1 07:20 MultiAxisChart-1.0-SNAPSHOT.pom 
-rw-r--r-- 1 jvuser staff   201   Apr 1 07:21 _remote.repositories 
-rw-r--r-- 1 jvuser staff   712   Apr 1 07:21 maven-metadata-local.xml
```

3. Build JVSD:

``` pre
$ ./gradlew -x test geode-jvsd:installDist 
:geode-jvsd:MultiAxisChartFX SKIPPED 
:geode-jvsd:compileJava 
Note: Some input files use unchecked or unsafe operations. 
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details. 
:geode-jvsd:processResources 
:geode-jvsd:classes 
:geode-jvsd:jar 
:geode-jvsd:startScripts 
:geode-jvsd:installDist 

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
```

4. Invoke JVSD from the command line:

``` pre
$ ./geode-jvsd/build/install/geode-jvsd/bin/geode-jvsd
```

## Configure Statistics Sampling in <span class="keyword">Geode</span>

Before you use JVSD, you must enable the collection of <span class="keyword">Geode</span> statistics at runtime. Set the following configurations in gemfire.properties:

``` pre
statistic-sampling-enabled=true
statistic-archive-file=myStats.gfs
```

Since collecting statistics at the default sampling rate of once every second does not affect performance, we recommend that sampling should always be enabled, including during development, testing, and in production.

There is a special category of statistics called time-based statistics that can be very useful in troubleshooting and assessing the performance of some <span class="keyword">Geode</span> operations, but they should be used with caution because their collection can affect performance. These statistics can be enabled using the following gemfire.properties configuration:

``` pre
enable-time-statistics=true
```

When the distributed system is up and running, every <span class="keyword">Geode</span> instance generates a statistics file. To simplify browsing these statistics in JVSD, you may want to copy all the statistics files from all members into one directory so that you can easily load the files into JVSD.
